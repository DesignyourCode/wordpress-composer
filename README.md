# Wordpress Composer

Install and run wordpress using composer only.

## **This is a work in progress!**

## Getting Started

1. Fork this project for your own site
2. Add your theme folder into `wp-content/themes`

    >  **Tip:** The [timber-starter-theme](https://github.com/upstatement/timber-starter-theme) is included as a dependency that you can use as a parent theme.

3. Add any required plugins as [wpackagist](http://wpackagist.org/) packages
4. Run `composer update` to pull in the latest version of the wordpress core and any other dependencies you've defined
5. Point a web server at the root of the project

   > **Tip:** If you don't have one set up, you can use the PHP built-in webserver, like this: `php -S localhost:8000`
